Hello_world
===========

Enrolling github.
I'm here to learn the mysteries of programming and cofee making.
I think i'm doing something wrong already. Where's my commit messages?
Got this, I can see commit messages clicking on dots next to a commit entry in history. Adding a comment is a new commmit change. All this looks confusing at first.
